This project develops an infrastructural framework for exploring relational being as a mode of existence. Rather than advancing a single theory or empirical claim, it provides a structured overview of the conditions under which relational being can be understood, enacted, generated, sustained, and carried across contexts.

Here, “infrastructure” is understood as a set of enabling conditions—conceptual, theoretical, procedural, social, and ethical—that support the unfolding of relational being. The project organizes these conditions into seven interrelated infrastructural domains:

1. Theoretical Infrastructure, providing formal and modelable frameworks for articulating relational structures and generative processes.

2. Conceptual and Ontological Understanding Infrastructure, clarifying core principles of relation, being, presence, structure, and generation.

3. Co-presence Infrastructure, supporting the experiential conditions through which relations are perceived and enacted across distance and mediation.

4. Decision Infrastructure, enabling relational action and governance to unfold through accountable, process-oriented, and evidence-informed practices.

5. Co-creative Infrastructure, sustaining the generative emergence of new relations, meanings, and structures through shared practices.

6. Educational Infrastructure, cultivating and transmitting relational capacities across individuals, communities, and generations.

7. Ethical and Care Infrastructure, carrying and reconstituting relations under conditions of vulnerability, asymmetry, and dependence.

As a top-level OSF project, this repository serves as a conceptual map and coordination space. It may host or reference multiple subprojects addressing specific infrastructures, methods, applications, or case studies. Together, these components form an integrated condition structure for relational being, supporting its continuous unfolding across theoretical, practical, and institutional domains.
