# Relational Being Infrastructure

This repository provides a conceptual and organizational infrastructure for research oriented toward relational being or relational existence. Infrastructure is understood not merely as technical tooling, but as the conditions that allow relational forms of existence to be articulated, sustained, generated, and preserved across disciplines.

The project adopts a multi-dimensional perspective in which infrastructures are treated as relational conditions rather than exclusive categories. Individual research projects may therefore relate to multiple infrastructural dimensions simultaneously. To support this, the repository emphasizes reverse indexing, explicit relational references, and a clear separation between infrastructure, projects, and research outputs.

This repository functions as a meta-level framework. It hosts conceptual definitions, infrastructural indexes, and documentation of methodological, ethical, and dissemination principles. Concrete research outputs—such as preprints, manuscripts, or codebases—are intentionally maintained in independent repositories and linked rather than absorbed, preserving autonomy, version clarity, and long-term sustainability.

The infrastructure is designed to evolve. Stability is introduced deliberately through documentation, versioning, and archival practices, without foreclosing future conceptual development.
